							<h1>UXR Project - Pandemic Learning Agility</h1>
							<section>
								
								<h2>OVERVIEW</h2><br>
								This is a research-focused project aiming for understanding the learning agility of Learning & Development professionals and providing foundational instruction on the training design.

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-7 col-12-medium">
										<h3>problem</h3>
										Throughout 2020 and 2021, almost every organization evolved and shifted to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizations’ learning & development (L&D) department underwent drastic changes due to working-form-home (WFH).  play a pivotal role in transitioning and in envisioning and implementing changes within the organization. 
 										<br><br>	
										However, there is little primary research on the learning agility of L&D professionals in life sciences sector. Understanding it was essential and urgent for supporting L&D professionals’ work and potentially critical to the survival and growth of organizations. 
										
										<h3>Overarching Research questions:</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>How did L&D professionals in the life sciences sector perceive and respond to the changes in their work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic?</li>
										 	<li>How did L&D professionals in the life sciences sector demonstrate learning agility during remote working?</li>	
										</ul>
										
									</div>
									<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
										<h3>My role</h3>
										Lead researcher of the research team <br>(2-4 researchers and 2 industry consultants)
										<h3>target audience</h3>
										Trainers and educators who serve the companies in the life sciences field, e.g., pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturing companies, biotechnology companies.
										<h3>Timeline</h3>
										September 2020 - December 2021

                            <h2>Process</h2>
                               
                            <h3>Methods</h3>
							<br>
							We adopted a mixed method to approach the research questions: <br>
							<b>Literature review</b> – to define the scope of the study and to construct the framework <br>
							<b>Qualitative interviews</b> – to extract key insights from experienced practitioners<br>
							<b>Quantitative survey</b> – to validate preliminary findings with a representative sample
							<br><br>
                            <h3>findings</h3>

							<h3>key takeaways</h3><br>
							<ul>
								<li>They reported generally positive perceptions towards organizations’ responses to COVID-19.</li>
								<li>They perceived high productivity and increased digital competencies during working remotely.</li>
								<li>They reported upskilling and reskilling opportunities due to working from home and in preparation for virtual training.</li>
								<li>Video conference tools, tools to engage customers, and tools to help learners with information recall were the most frequently used technologies and were perceived to be the most important.</li>
								<li>They all believed a new normal would occur after COVID-19.</li>
								<li>They did not perceive a major change under the way in a short-term, they all perceived that major changes would occur in a long-term.</li>
								<li>Elements of learning agility were demonstrated by most participants in response to a highly disruptive crisis, when working mode abruptly shifted.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<h2>Implications</h2><br>
							<h6>Be Flexible</h6>
							This study provides insights into how the pandemic created a <b>context that sparked a different entry point</b> (i.e., the drive for job survival) into the learning agility development cycle. 
							This study also provides insights into how the COVID-19 crisis demanded professionals’ learning agility to both <b>self-initiate their own learning</b> and to <b>support the learning agility of others</b> in the organization.

							<h6>Be Prepared</h6>
							In retrospect, <b>the first 3 months</b> of the pandemic were a survival phase for most of the organizations in the life-sciences sector. 
							Leaderships lacked experience and confidence in their solutions during such a turbulent time. 
							<b>The next several months</b> presented an adoption phase which was marked by a collective will to make change. 
							<b>Looking towards the future</b> as vaccines are more prevalent, organizations are now more competent to shift into a proactive phase. 
							They have more experience dealing with unprecedented changes in the global environment. 

							<h6>Be Foresightful</h6>
							The changes in work life, due to the COVID-19 crisis, may have <b>pushed the development of the industry 5-7 years forward</b> into the future in a few months. 
							<b>The forces that prompted the development</b> include the organization’s drives for financial success, customer demands, and more prominently the practitioners’ adaptation and agility. 
							They demonstrated a willingness to be agile that may not have emerged as quickly outside of the pandemic crisis. 
							It is predictable that <b>a mix of live and virtual solutions</b> for training and learning would emerge to better suit the ever-changing market in life sciences organizations.
